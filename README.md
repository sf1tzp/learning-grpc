# gRPC Hello World

Sourced from [grpc/grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/examples/helloworld). Thanks!

## Prerequisites

This repo includes [google's apis](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/tree/master/google/rpc) as a submodule, in order to import some of their `.proto` files. Run `git submodule upgdate --init --recusive` after cloning this repo to retrieve the files.

To generate grpc bindings for each language, you need to have `protoc`, and each langague's plugin installed:
- [`protoc` installation instructions](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)
- [go plugin installation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/#prerequisites)
- Rust gRPC bindings are generated by the `tonic` crate (included in project)
- Node gRPC bindings are generated by the `grpc-js` module's `grpc_tools_node_protoc` tool (included in projedct)

This repo includes a [Justfile](https://github.com/casey/just). Available recipes:
```
    generate    # Generate gRPC bindings for both projects
    go-client   # Run the go-based client
    go-server   # Run the go-based server
    rust-client # Run the rust-based client
    rust-server # Run the rust-based server
    node-client # Run the typescript-based client
```
